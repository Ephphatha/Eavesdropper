This is a simple utility designed to record from your microphone and write what
is heard to an hourly mp3 file.

As soon as the program runs it will start recording, close the program to stop
recording and close the most recent file.

Data is written directly to disk, but the file handle is not closed until the
program has no need for the file anymore. If the program crashes you may lose
up to an hours worth of data.
